# Plugin and Hook System

## Overview

The plugin and hook system allows developers to extend the functionality of the PHP CRUD API Generator. By using this system, you can easily customize the behavior of the application without modifying the core code.

## Creating a Plugin

To create a plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new PHP file** in the `plugins` directory of your project. The file name should be descriptive of the plugin's functionality.

2. **Define a class** in your PHP file that implements the `PluginInterface`:

   ```php
   namespace YourNamespace\Plugins;

   use YourNamespace\PluginInterface;

   class YourPlugin implements PluginInterface {
       public function registerHooks() {
           // Register your hooks here
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Register the plugin** in your main application file.

## Using Hooks

Hooks are points in the application where you can attach custom functionality. You can use the following types of hooks:

- **Action Hooks**: Perform actions at specific points in the application.
- **Filter Hooks**: Modify data before it is sent to the output.

### Example of Action Hook

```php
add_action('custom_action_hook', 'your_custom_function');

function your_custom_function() {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Example of Filter Hook

```php
add_filter('custom_filter_hook', 'your_filter_function');

function your_filter_function($data) {
    // Modify $data here
    return $data;
}
```

## Conclusion

By utilizing the plugin and hook system, you can extend the functionality of the PHP CRUD API Generator in a clean and maintainable way. For further information, refer to the official documentation.
